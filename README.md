# readingView
## Cleaning text from a url using the Goose package for Python
Takes the URL as user input and prints the text from the webpage similar to the reading view function in Safari.
The Goose package for ```python ```is written by [grangier](https://github.com/grangier/python-goose).
Goose uses beautifulsoup to parse text, nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) to tokenise and clean.
